The Coursera Specialization, "Managing Big Data with MySQL" consists of a 5-week course to learn SQL (MySQL and TERADATA) to interact with complex databases to find relationships between data and create value for business . Two real databases donated by the companies [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com/) and [Dillard's](https://www.dillards.com/) are used to learn from basic to advanced SQL concepts. 






---
The [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com/) database has hundred of thousands of rows is accesible throw mySQL. Exersices were done using Jupyter notebooks. 
You can find some exersices [here](https://github.com/nicoambrosis/Managing-Bid-Data-with-SQL/tree/main/MySQL). 

---
The [Dillard's](https://www.dillards.com/) database has more than 120 million rows and is accesible throw Teradata. Excersices were done using the web based platform for [Teradata](https://www.teradata.com/).
