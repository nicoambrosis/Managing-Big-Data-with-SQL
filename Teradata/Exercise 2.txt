Exercise 2. Use a CASE statement within an aggregate function to determine which sku
had the greatest total sales during the combined summer months of June, July, and August.

SELECT sku,
       SUM(CASE WHEN (EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)=2005) AND EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=6 THEN amt ELSE 0 END) AS ventas_junio,
       SUM(CASE WHEN (EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)=2005) AND EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=7 THEN amt ELSE 0 END) AS ventas_julio,
       SUM(CASE WHEN (EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate)=2004) AND EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate)=8 THEN amt ELSE 0 END) AS ventas_agosto,
       (ventas_junio + ventas_julio + ventas_agosto) AS ventas_verano
       

FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P'
GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY ventas_verano DESC;
