Exercise 8: Examine all the transactions for the sku with the greatest standard deviation in
sprice, but only consider skus that are part of more than 100 transactions.

SELECT s.brand,
       t.sku,
       STDDEV_POP(sprice) AS std_price,
       COUNT(DISTINCT trannum) AS tran_num 
FROM trnsact t JOIN skuinfo s ON t.sku = s.sku
GROUP BY t.sku, s.brand
HAVING tran_num > 100
ORDER BY std_price DESC;
